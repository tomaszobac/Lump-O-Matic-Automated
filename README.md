This extension adds the automation option to the original mod.

When active, it will check every 5 minutes whether the lump is mature. If it is, then it will start the scumming process just like when clicking the button.

EPILEPSY WARNING: The Steam version of this mod causes the game to constantly reload, causing the screen to alternate flashing colors. If you are sensitive to that, be wary.
